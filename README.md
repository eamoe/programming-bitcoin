# Bitcoin

## Transactions

At a high level, transaction has 4 components:
- **version** - shows which additional features the transaction uses.
- **inputs** - defines what bitcoins are being spent.
- **outputs** - defines where the bitcoins are going.
- **locktime** - defines when the transaction starts being valid.
